# AI-Resume-Critique-Web-App

This is a small HTML/CSS project Ive been working on that includes backend development using Python and Flask. The webpage prompts the user to upload their resume (PDF) and my code finds grammar errors, how readable it is, if theres any passive voice being used, and the average sentence length. Tools such as spacy, textstat, and language_tool_python helped me extract these kind of data. Next, I used the Cohere API to bring live feedback from AI to determine if theres any other fixes in the resume that I didn't get with my tools. 

This project helped me learn so much about API integrationa and solifided my skills with Python and fullstack development.
